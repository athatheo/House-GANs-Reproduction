# House-GANs-Reproduction
Reproduction Code of [House-GAN: Relational Generative Adversarial Networks for Graph-constrained House Layout Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06988)
Original code can be found in the Nelson Nauata's (first author) [github page](https://github.com/ennauata/housegan).

### What parts are reproduced?
Specific goals regarding the reproduced parts will be added soon.

### Why did we do this?
Well, first of all it's a great paper and an interesting read.
Secondly, it is a project for the course [CS4240 Deep Learning](https://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=57391&_NotifyTextSearch_) in TU Delft.
